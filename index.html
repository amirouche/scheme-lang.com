	    <p>Let's agree that <b>serif</b> fonts do not always carry boring stuff. And have a taste of it:</p>

	    <p>Otherwise said, Scheme wants to offer of a minimalist
	    core of powerful primitives upon which one can build
	    abstractions to solve (real world) problems.</p>
	    <p>Scheme universe is vast and prolific. As programming
	    languages, Scheme dialects target various niches and
	    implement various paradigms. Some of them are part of the
		standards (namely R<sup>n</sup>RS and SRFI).</p>
	    <p>The most famous paradigm and agreed upon practices
		evolve around Functional Programming.</p>
	    <p>Scheme might be a dynamically typed language, it can
		compete with its scions and siblings when performance
		matters.</p>
	    <p>Few programming languages can compete with Scheme when
		it comes to Science whether it is Programming Language
		Theory, or Artificial Intelligence.</p>
	    <p>That being said, Scheme implementations might be
		missing some love. That's a good opportunity for you
		to learn something useful and give something back. Or
		like others, make it your secret weapon.</p>
